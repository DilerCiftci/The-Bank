# The-Bank
Let me present to you, my terminal based program that acts like an atm machine.

When started, the program welcomes you and gives you 4 options to choose from.

(You simply choose an option by typing a number between 1-4.)

After each choice and action, you'll get redirected to the main meny again through a loop.

The program will stop and close when the fourth option "Exit" is chosen.

Feel free to test my program and leave any feedback. Have fun!

Programming language: JAVA
